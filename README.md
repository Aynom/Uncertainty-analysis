# Uncertainty-analysis
Ensemble-based uncetainty analysis in hydrological modelling

This repository contains the main algorithms implemented to conduct parameter and prediction uncertainty analysis based on the 
residual based (GLUE) and the time relaxed limits of acceptability (GLUE pLoA) approaches. 
In most of the analyses, the underlying concepts were demonstrated using combined likelihood of streamflow and MODIS fractional snow cover area (fSCA). 
Many of the algorithms were adopted from the SAFE Toolbox (Pianosi et al, 2015) and they interact with relevant scripts in that toolbox. 

The time relaxed limits of acceptability approach (GLUE pLoA) is a variant of the GLUE LoA methodology and it was introduced in the following paper. The reader is referred to this paper for details on the conceptual background, implementation, and sample outputs from the different algorithms included in this repository.
