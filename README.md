# Uncertainty-analysis
Ensemble-based uncetainty analysis in hydrological modelling

This repository contains the main algorithms implemented to conduct uncertainty analysis based on the 
residual based (GLUE) and the time relaxed limits of acceptability (GLUE pLoA)concepts. 
In most of the analyses, combined likelihood of streamflow and MODIS fractional snow cover area (fSCA) were employed . 
Many of the algorithms were adopted from the SAFE Toolbox (Pianosi et al, 2015) and interact with different scripts in that toolbox. 

The time relaxed limits of acceptability approach (GLUE pLoA) is a variant of the GLUE LoA methodology and it was introduced in the following paper. The reader is referred to this paper for details on the conceptual background, implementation, and sample outputs from the different algorithms included in this repository.
